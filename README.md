# Age-Estimation-from-partial-Dorsal-and-Palmar-Hand-Images
Conducted a comparative analysis on conventional ML algorithms (SVR, LGBMR, and RFR) and a state-of-the-art DL technique (DenseNet201). The SVR model achieved a Mean Squared Error of 1.33 years and an RMSE of 1.15 years. 
DenseNet201 significantly outperformed the other models, with an MSE of 0.66 years and RMSE of 0.81 years, indicating
its effectiveness in capturing complex data relationships
